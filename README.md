reqirement:pytorch, python and some basic packages.

command segments setting is coded in 'solver.py'

Time logs are coded as well, have fun to run the code!

### Get Started
1. Install Python 3.6, PyTorch >= 1.4.0. 
(Thanks Élise for the contribution in solving the environment. See this [issue](https://github.com/thuml/Anomaly-Transformer/issues/11) for details.)
2. Download data. You can obtain four benchmarks from [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gisthCoE-RrKJ0j3KPV7xiibhHWT9qRm?usp=sharing). **All the datasets are well pre-processed**. For the SWaT dataset, you can apply for it by following its official tutorial.
3. Train and evaluate. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:

Here, I write other commands in '.sh' documents, you can run them.

```bash
bash ./scripts/SMD.sh
bash ./scripts/MSL.sh
bash ./scripts/SMAP.sh
bash ./scripts/PSM.sh
``
